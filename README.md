# BoneRegenration_PPI_network-analysis-with-networkx
A network that includes genes related to bone regeneration was construct and analyze to study the hub genes of a network for recognizing potentially the most important genes in the network. the bone regeneration related genes were collected from the regenerative gene database( http://regene.bioinfo-minzhao.org/ ). Based on regeneration gene databases 45 different gene is collaborating in bone regeneration process and here you can see the all gnes from this database(table1)
In this research we use protein-protein interaction(PPI) data from STRING (https://string-db.org/) .the PPI network was constructed by python package networkx and Cytoscape .centrality analysis is applied with networkx python package .centrality measurements were applied on network analysis to figure out the hub genes . 3 different types of centrality used: degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. we use three different functions of the networkx library for calculating centrality :1. degree_centrality 2. closeness_centrality 3. betweenness_centrality .
